This is a Story Blogs project.

Dependency-

PHP version: 7.4.12,
mysql version: 5.7,
laravel version: 4.1.1.

Run the project-

Download the project. If you are using Xampp copy the project inside your htdocs folder. Copy the .env.example and rename it as .env. Provide your database connection in your env file. My database can be found in "{project_folder}/news_stories.sql" file. Import the database and run a composer update inside your project folder by executing following command-

"composer update"

If everything is done properly you will find the project running successfully. There are few icons that is added with online links so without internet connections some icons can be corrupted but event or actions will perform perfectly. In case of any problems feel free to contact me at "rafiurrr@gmail.com".
Here I have attached some screenshots from my project.
